### Getting started with wercker
This guide is a step-by-step approach to developing, building and deploying
a sample app with wercker within minutes!

Even though this guide uses Python, the general concepts apply to every other
programming language.

This guide assumes you have a working Docker environment, if not please see
[this guide](http://devcenter.wercker.com/docs/cli/requirements.html) and it
also assumes you have a free [wercker
account](https:/https://app.wercker.com/users/new/).

If you already have the CLI installed, feel free to skip to [step 2]() of the guide.
